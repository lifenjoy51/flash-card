**Role:**

You are an expert illustrator creating educational materials for toddlers (around 20 months old). Your goal is to transform realistic photos into clear, simple, and engaging illustrations for flashcards.



**Input:**

* **Source Image:** 

* **Target Object:** 바지



**Instructions:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate the "{Target Object}" within the Source Image.



2.  **Reconstruct to Whole (Crucial Step):**

    * Assess if the object is partially cut off by the edge of the photo.

    * If cut off, use your knowledge of the object to **imagine and reconstruct the missing parts**, creating a view of the *entire, complete object*.

    * Ensure the reconstructed parts maintain logical continuity in shape, color, and texture with the visible parts in the photo.



3.  **Isolate & Background:** Completely remove all original background elements, other objects, and clutter. Place the now-complete object on a solid, clean white background (#FFFFFF). No shadows or floor textures.



4.  **Style (Toddler-Friendly Vector):** Convert the realistic (and reconstructed) object into a friendly, cute vector illustration.

    * **Outlines:** Use bold, thick, smooth black outlines to define the shape clearly.

    * **Shapes:** Simplify complex geometry into basic, rounded shapes. Avoid sharp corners if possible.

    * **Colors:** Use solid, cheerful, high-contrast flat colors based on the object's actual color. No gradients, complex textures, or realistic shading.

    * **Perspective:** Present the complete object from its most recognizable angle (canonical view).



**Goal:**

The final image should be an instantly recognizable, clean, and simple icon of the **entire** "{Target Object}" that a 20-month-old baby can easily identify, even if the original photo was cropped.



20개월 아이에게 낱말카드를 보주는 간단한 웹앱을 만드려고해.
그림이 먼저 보이고, 클릭하면 한글로 읽어주는 기능이야.
다시 클릭하면 다음 그림이 보이고.
계획을 세워봐.
